                Palayur Mar Thoma Church, one of the Ēḻarappaḷḷikaḷ (seven major churches), is a testimony to the Apostolic legacy 
                of St. Thomas. The church's rich history, from the first baptism performed in India to its role in spreading Christianity, 
                attracts visitors from around the globe.

                According to Saint Thomas Christian tradition, Thomas traveled from Muziris (Kodungallur) to Palayur by boat through the backwaters.
                Palayur was then a stronghold of Brahmins and Jews.
                He visited Jewish merchants at Judankunnu ("Hill of Jews") to preach the Christian gospel.
                Though the area has since become dry land, the historic boat jetty, locally called "Bottukulam," is preserved as a monument to St. Thomas.

                Of the seven churches traditionally established by Thomas, three claim continuity: Palayur in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur,
                Kottakkavu in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly, and Niranam in the Malankara Orthodox Diocese of Niranam.

                Historical records recount that when Thomas arrived at Palayur, he saw Brahmins performing ablutions and offering water to the Sun god as part of their Vedic rituals. 
                Thomas challenged them, stating their offerings were not being accepted as the water fell back into the tank. He claimed that his God would accept their offerings, 
                and to prove it, he performed a miracle: he threw water into the air, and it remained suspended. Witnessing this, many Brahmins and Jews embraced Christianity.

                Thomas baptized the converts in a nearby water tank, now known as "Thaliyakulam" or "The First Baptism Pond," 
                regarded as the birthplace of Christianity in India.
